This is a repository for the structures used in Dr. Inna Ponomareva's research group at the University of South Florida. 
Our group investigates ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics using computational methodologies. 
We use a variety of methods including density functional theory (DFT), first-pricinples based molecular dynamics simulations, and first-pricinples based Monte Carlo simulations.
More information about our group can be found here: http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~iponomar/index.html
